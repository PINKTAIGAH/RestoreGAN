# RestoreGAN
An implementation of RestoreGAN to be used in image dejittering at the P06 experiment at PETRA III

#### Note that code has been written such that it expects a single input images
from the dataset. This would mean that the left image is the Jittered truth image
while the right image is the unjittered ground truth
